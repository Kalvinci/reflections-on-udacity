1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Just some meta data files are added to the repository. We need to initialize a repository so as to use the powers of git version control.


2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the place where we add files that are to be committed. The staging area is a virtual place where push all the upcoming commits whereas directory and repository are actual places where we create files, edit them.
